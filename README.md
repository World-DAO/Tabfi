# TabFi for SUI Overflow

**— Fund Now, Pay Never** 💡

**TabFi** is a decentralized payment protocol built on **Sui**. It solves a key issue in "Buy Now, Pay Later" models: delayed merchant payments.

Instead of promising future interest, TabFi lets users **lend funds temporarily to merchants**, who use the **interest** to provide goods or services. Merchants get **immediate cash flow**, and users enjoy **zero-cost purchases**.

## 🔧 How It Works

- Users lend funds (e.g. $100 for 12 months)
- Merchants instantly receive and use the funds
- Users get goods in return (e.g. a $4 coffee)
- After the term, merchants repay the principal

It’s interest-for-product, not money-for-product.
